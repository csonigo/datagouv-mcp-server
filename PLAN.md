# Development Plan for Data.gouv.fr MCP Server

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Data.gouv.fr MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. The server enables interaction with Data.gouv.fr APIs through the MCP protocol.

## 1. Cursor Configuration with .cursor file

**Objective**: Improve Cursor's understanding of project guidelines.

- [x] Create `.cursor` file in project root
- [x] Define code conventions
- [x] Document project structure
- [x] Specify technologies used (TypeScript, MCP)
- [x] Define architecture rules

## 2. TypeScript Best Practices Implementation

**Objective**: Improve code quality and maintainability.

### 2.1 Code Quality Tools
- [x] Configure ESLint with strict rules
  - [x] Add TypeScript-specific rules
  - [x] Configure import/export rules
  - [x] Set up code style rules
- [x] Add Prettier for code formatting
- [x] Configure pre-commit hooks with husky
- [x] Set up lint-staged for staged files

### 2.2 TypeScript Configuration

- [ ] Geolocation search
  - [ ] Add radius search
  - [ ] Implement map integration
- [ ] Company comparison
  - [ ] Compare multiple companies
  - [ ] Generate comparison reports
